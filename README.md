# Spring-exercises
<p>
Spring exercises: random website with lists, detail page, basic rest support, a simple rest call to get weather info, authentication en authorization.  </p>
<p>
Things I learned, or atleast have basic knowledge of in spring: spring mvc, spring forms, spring security, java beans, aspect oriented programming, REST service/client 
<br>
Also modified datasource to check if the application is deployed on openshift or local, but there was is an unresolved error. 
<br>
The localisation option only changes filiale <-> branches in the 'lijst' option,so site is only in dutch at the moment.
